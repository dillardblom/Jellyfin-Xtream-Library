// GitHub #102. The Live TV config tab had three documentation defects:
//   1. The Native Tuner warning instructed users to add the M3U URL as a "HDHomeRun tuner",
//      which Jellyfin's Add Tuner dialog rejects for M3U input. The correct type is "M3U Tuner".
//   2. The text claimed the plugin's own tuner "does not appear under Dashboard -> Live TV ->
//      Tuner Devices". XtreamTunerHost registers an ITunerHost with Type "xtream-library", which
//      Jellyfin lists in the Add Tuner type dropdown unconditionally. The docs must acknowledge
//      that and tell users not to add it manually.
//   3. The "Setup URLs" section lumped all three URLs under "Dashboard -> Live TV -> Add Tuner",
//      but only the M3U goes there. The EPG belongs in TV Guide Data Providers, and the Catch-up
//      M3U is not consumed by Jellyfin at all.
